Smart Traffic Prediction and Caching Using Machine Learning Techniques in Fog Radio Access Networks

Domain: Machine Learning Techniques

Description: A cognitive caching strategy based on LSTM and collaborative filtering is designed. The
performance of the proposed LSTM-based traffic prediction algorithm and cognitive caching strategy is
evaluated using simulation of IF-RAN architecture in a real environment
